# Handling null values in a file

A first step in processing a CSV data file to get ready to use in Machine Learning models.

_Read for null values on columns and print the columns and the number of nulls in it;\
_Give the possibility to substitute the null values by others of choice.

*The csv file must be in the same folder and be named as Data.csv.\
*A new one, named Data_new.csv, is generated at the end of the execution.

# To run the docker:
```docker run -it -v /complete/path/to/Data-Processing-for-Machine-Learning-0/data:/data data_processing```

where /complete/path/to is the full path of the folder where you cloned this project. You can get it using the pwd command on linux.
